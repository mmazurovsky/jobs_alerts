  Key Principles
  - Write code on your own and put it in the codebase immediately instead of asking if you should do it or not.
  - Use data classes to pass data to functions.
  - Use types for data as much as possible.
  - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
  - Minimize code duplication.
  - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., is_active, has_permission).
  - Use lowercase with underscores for directories and files (e.g., routers/user_routes.py).
  - Favor named exports for routes and utility functions.
  - Use the Receive an Object, Return an Object (RORO) pattern.
  - Don't override default serializing or deserializing methods.
  - When serializing/deserizlizing enums, use enum names, not values.
  - For datetime objects serialize and deserialize using ISO 8601
